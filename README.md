# Titanic-ML
Machine Learning from Disaster

> In this project we will explore and analyze the famous Titanic Dataset using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `dython`. After that, we will prepare the dataset for model training, consider four different ML models from the popular `sklearn` and `xgboost` libraries, and then assess the accuracy of each model using the cross validation data. Ultimately, we will choose the best ML model, apply it the test dataset to predict which passengers of Titanic survived.
